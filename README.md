#COVID-19 ETL Pipeline

This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built with PySpark, PostgreSQL, and Apache Superset to analyze COVID-19 data (2020â€“2025). It extracts raw data from CSV, transforms it into a clean structured format, and loads it into PostgreSQL for visualization in Superset.
